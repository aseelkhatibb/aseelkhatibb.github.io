### CPSC 120

* Lab 4

    Lab 4, part 2 was one of my favorites due to this being my first lab working with if statements. I was able to write functions that utilized  less than and greater than symbols. I also enjoyed the testing aspect of this lab because I basically created a game, so when testing the code, it was as if I was playing a guessing game. Not only was this lab educational, it was highly functional which I believe was verily beneficial.

* Lab 6

    One of my favorite parts of Lab 6, part 2 was getting to play the game Blackjack for the first time. As a result, I had to learn the rules from scratch, including the tricky Ace values. It was challenging to determine the correct Ace value, especially when it could result in a bust. Additionally, I gained valuable experience in writing functions that utilized the or/and symbols and incorporated card values.

* Lab 7

    In Lab 7, I had an amazing experience exploring the concept of parking time validation. By utilizing bool values, I was able to accurately determine the correctness of parking time. Additionally, I became more familiar with extended if statements, which helped me to write more complex and efficient code. This experience has significantly enriched my knowledge on if statements.
